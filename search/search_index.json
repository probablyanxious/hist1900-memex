One of the most powerful readings from this semester was the poem \"Questions From A Worker Who Reads\" by Bertolt Brecht and this was the first introduction I had to really digging in and asking those questions like who is behind the camera of historical photos, who had their stories prioritized in the preservation of records, what bright minds did we lose due to bigotry and closed-mindedness? </p> <p>This idea pivots into the second most powerful takeaway of this course; having a personal memex. I remember how satisfying it was for me when it really clicked. It was a quote from Alan Turing\u2019s Forgotten Ideas in Computer Science that made me truly understand the importance of note-taking and documenting my research, no matter what the subject. If someone one day wants to pick my brain, I don't want for all my ideas and work to be lost. If I myself want to go back and look at the sources I've accumulated, the writings I've done, the things I've thought of - having it all organized in my own personal memex (as coined by Vannevar Bush) makes it much easier to track and keep record of.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_1/#the-journey-between-websitethoughtsuntold-stories-and-website-20thoughtsconnection-to-memex","title":"The Journey Between website/Thoughts/Untold Stories and WEBSITE 2.0/THOUGHTS/Connection to Memex","text":"<ul> <li>Untold Stories</li> <li>As We May Think</li> <li>From Clay Tablets to Web</li> <li>Questions From A Worker Who Reads</li> <li>Alan Turing\u2019s Forgotten Ideas in Computer Science</li> <li>Connection to Memex</li> </ul>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":"<p>Did you meet\u00a0your\u00a0goals for this course? Why or why not? (and also perhaps, how?)</p> <p>When I began to understand this course better and got over the surprise of a no essay, no exam format, I honestly got a bit nervous. I didn't know if I could succeed in a course where I needed to rely on my notes and my own research. I made it a personal goal to push myself, challenge my own habits, and most importantly; trust that I'm capable enough to succeed. </p> <p>For full transparency, I felt out of place when the course started and I wondered if I was even smart enough to be in this class. I may be tech-savvy enough to impress my grandparents or work my way around photoshop, but actually understanding the building blocks of the early internet and computing days was way over my head. I struggled to keep up with the concepts we were learning and as you can see from some of my early notes (Feb 15 In Class Notes), I was a bit all over the place. While I kept up with the assignments and readings, I was consistently putting myself down for my lack of quality notes, but at the same time believed that there was no point in trying if I just didn't get it.</p> <p>Our Unconference Style Class showed me that it's okay to think differently, and that there is no cookie-cutter approach to this class. It proved that everyone interprets things in their own way, shaped by their own experiences and knowledge. I decided to try and apply myself more to the in-class material. I tried to absorb as much as possible and write it down even if I didn't quite get it at the time. I started to ask more questions in class and spend more time reviewing my notes and making connections. (Side note, I think it's kinda cool to compare my learning curve to the development of early internet as it was all about building those connections and filling in the needs of the time)</p> <p>This journey is meant to showcase the development in my note-taking and the growth I experienced throughout this course. I feel like I've met my goals of pushing myself and learning to build myself up, not tear myself down. If I didn't feel smart enough coming in, I feel more than capable now for my future endeavours.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-3-atomic_notesin-class-note-feb-1-and-website-30takeawaysapril-3rd-notes","title":"The Journey Between 3-atomic_notes/In Class Note - Feb 1 and website 3.0/takeaways/April 3rd notes","text":"<ul> <li>Feb 15 In Class Notes</li> <li> </li> <li>Unconference Style Class</li> <li>March 13 class notes</li> <li>March 27th class</li> <li>April 3rd notes</li> </ul> <p>note: my tag system was only implemented in obsidian. tags were removed from final pages uploaded to github due to the fact that they looked ugly</p> <p></p> <p>^ Low quality gif I made of the Memex coming to be</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#takeaways","title":"takeaways","text":""},{"location":"Starting%20Point/","title":"Starting Point","text":"<p>\u273f New and Improved with the launch of Sophie's Memex 2.0!</p>"},{"location":"Starting%20Point/#changes-and-updates-march-10th-2023","title":"Changes and updates / March 10th 2023","text":"<p>Feedback based changes/additions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>More specific map of content \u00a0\u2192 Added subheadings to table of content with links to their index pages. </p> </li> <li> <p>More atomic notes \u00a0\u2192 Focused on increasing the volume of notes without losing content value, but kept them shorter to keep up with the idea of having \"concise explorations\" </p> </li> <li> <p>Include annotations \u00a0\u2192 Included annotations in notes!</p> </li> </ul> <p>Other changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Made sure that dates are visible on notes, not just exclusively in metadata</p> </li> <li> <p>Linked out to classmate's memex to provide interconnections</p> </li> <li> <p>Created this starting point to make it easier to navigate!</p> </li> <li> <p>5+ source notes added, atomic/idea notes as appropriate - all marked as new for easy finding.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Starting%20Point/#changes-and-updates-april-9th-2023","title":"Changes and updates / April 9th 2023","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Made outerlinkages to other student's work more apparent and easy to access</p> </li> <li> <p>5 source notes added, idea and atomic notes as appropriate.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Starting%20Point/#start-here","title":"Start Here!","text":"<p>This memex is a collection of experiences, thoughts, readings, and more related to Dr. Graham's History of the Internet (HIST1900c) course at Carleton University.</p> <p>I'd like to encourage you to take a tour around the memex as you will see that every note is connected to another in some form.

In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users. - Bibliography: Shiv Kumar, SK. 2013 From Clay Tablets to Web: Journey of Library Catalogue.

In the late nineteenth century, British firms held a near monopoly, because Britain had more advanced industry, a wealthier capital market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire that provided customers for the new service. After the 1880s, they encountered increasing competition on the North Atlantic from American, German, and French firms. Elsewhere, the British conglomerate Eastern and Associated retained its hegemony until the 1920s. Following World War I, radiotelegraphy threatened the dominance of cables. In the 1930s, cable companies were almost bankrupted by the Depression and by competition from shortwave radio. - Bibliography: Headrick, DR and Griset, P. 2001 Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838-1939.

A clay tablet used to be the main method of sharing information, what would we call it today? What does it compare to? He had us lift our hand and see how a sample Bronze age clay tablet is fairly similar in size to our phones today. </p> <p>We talked for most of our time about the ways printing and collecting information has changed over the last thousand or so years, before he introduced us to the various printing presses he has in the Book Arts Lab.

In my opinion, this is due to a combination of antisemitism and a Christian perspective being the focused lens on history, especially during the Renaissance. Even in Kumar's From Clay Tablets to Web,  it is mentioned that monasteries played a huge role in the documenting of information and access to education in the 4th century (Kumar, 46). This means that the church had control over who had access to education and what information would be documented and preserved.</p> <p>I read some accounts of the Battle of Tours (723 CE) with three different perspectives: one was a Christian man living under Muslim rule in Toledo, one was a Muslim account from an Egyptian jurist, and one was Edward Gibben, a British man,  1000 years later. While each account had some similarities (they all recognized who died), they were drastically different in the method of telling the tale and showed obvious favours and biases. Of course this is the nature of humanity, but I can't help but wonder who is on the other side of each story that never got a chance to have their experiences documented. </p> <p>The preservation of information in particular is of interest to me, because who is it that decided what was important enough to keep?
