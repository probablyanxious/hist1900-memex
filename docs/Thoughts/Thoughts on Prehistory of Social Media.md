Title: My Thoughts on Prehistory of Social Media

I really enjoyed reading the article "A Prehistory of Social Media" by Kevin Driscoll (and appreciate that I found it through [Eric Hobson's Memex](https://erichobson.com/memex/)) for a couple of reasons. I found it fascinating, for one, as Driscoll explores the early access to the internet beyond ARPANET and the way that community-oriented groups developed the early modem. I really enjoy seeing this side of the history; the one that is more accessible and is not focused on government production or exclusive to large institutions.

I also really appreciated the incentive behind this article, as expressed in the quote below. 

>"... Exploring how these communities developed and sustained themselves not only provides a fuller history of the internet, but offers insights into how we might build healthier online communities that are more just, equitable, and inclusive."
