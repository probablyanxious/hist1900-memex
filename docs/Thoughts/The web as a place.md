Title: The Web As A Place

On March 27th we discussed GeoCities in class and the concept of the web as a place really stuck with me. The homesteading community and the geographical metaphor being used was really wholesome and was nurtured by the millions partaking. 

I love the idea of having a corner of the internet where you are producing things of your own rather than building up someone else's platform. The loss of GeoCities is what I believe to be a huge cultural and historical loss, as Internet Archive put it "Yahoo! succeeded in destroying the most amount of history in the shortest amount of time, certainly on purpose, in known memory. Millions of files, user accounts, all gone."
