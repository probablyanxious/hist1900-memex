Alan Turing has been a prominent figure in our class, and deservedly so.  As someone who joined this class without an ounce of knowledge on computer/internet history, I had no idea how his story would end.

My stomach dropped as soon as the slide popped up, and my heart broke at the details. It really just got worse and worse. I appreciate the delivery Dr. Graham provided on just how heartbreaking and atrocious it was, as after all, he was the man who saved Britain.

I had to do some additional reading after this class to appreciate to the fullest extent his legacy and mourn the loss of a great man and, in my opinion, a historically neglected member of the LGBT community.
