Title: My thoughts on AI as of right now

I think AI is scary, and not because of sci-fi films telling us that robots are going to bring an end to human civilization. It is what real people have managed to do with AI that scares me - such as AI generated "adult content" using the likeness of real humans without their consent. This was a huge scandal recently on the platform Twitch, and it really freaked me out.

A lesser extreme (but still disheartening) use of AI would be the word models being used to churn out papers for students. It makes me concerned for the integrity of future classes and the work they're willing to put in. I'm grateful that I have never been in a position where I feel that cheating is the only option, especially when it comes to written projects, but I wonder if the ease of accessibility to these large language models and the low likelihood of being caught will wear down students in my position. Ones who have never cheated or felt the need to, but end up wishing to plug in a prompt out of curiosity to see what results they get.
