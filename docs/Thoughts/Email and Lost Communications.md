Title: Email and Lost Communications

In reading about the early internet and the development of chat rooms and email, I began to wonder how much of my old data is just stuck out there. I have no access to the Hotmail account I made way too young, I can only imagine what a 9-year-old was doing with internet access and an email account.

I wish I could have partaken in GeoCities, I love the idea of [[The web as a place]] and the concept of homesteaders on the internet.
