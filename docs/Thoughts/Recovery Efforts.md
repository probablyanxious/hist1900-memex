When we started discussing the laying of transatlantic cables in class (see related links for class notes), I couldn't help but start wondering about the recovery efforts that would be in place after the numerous failed attempts. 

A quick google search led me to a website published by Bill Burns, who writes about the development of cable retrieving techniques and also provides images of recovered pieces of cable covered in coral (so cool). He explains how there was extensive charting involved in the laying of cables and calculation using electronic measurements using the cable charts helps to locate them for retrieval.
