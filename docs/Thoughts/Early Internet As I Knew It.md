In reading Benj Edwards' experience of the early internet, I realized just how much could change in the decade between his first internet encounter and mine. 

By the time I could access a computer, I was around 5 years old (2004) booting up Windows XP on my grandfather's computer. I think I am just a smidge too young to have experienced dial-up myself, but I know it was in our home. 

My first searches on the web were for unicorn backgrounds I could set the wallpaper to and logging in to the world of Neopets. 

I frequented many online games such as Neopets, Club Penguin, Webkinz, GoGirlGames, and pretty much every flash game website you could find.
