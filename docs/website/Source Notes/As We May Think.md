### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the article *As We May Think* (1945), Vannevar Bush applies his knowledge and experience as an American engineer to theorize on the future of cataloguing ones individual data. That is, of course, the bare minimum of what Bush achieves with this article. He imagines the future of photography, computers, and the concept of digitizing books and records. In the article he describes a device that can supplement one's memory by way of storing all their communications and records in one spot. 

His article is groundbreaking for its time and many of his concepts have come to fruition in modern day.
