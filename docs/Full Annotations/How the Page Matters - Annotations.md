> The page is more than a simple vehicle or container for the transmission of ideas; it is a part of those ideas, entangled in the story itself.[^1]

> we often overlook how the page sets the parameters for our engagement with ideas.[^1]

I don't know if this is meant to be more philosophical than how I'm interpreting it, but I can't help but think of how I can't stand certain lined papers to write on and how I've always preferred grid paper. The guides it provides can change how I interact with the page entirely.

> Egyptian scrolls could be as long as20 or 30 metres, although their Greek counterpaits were more often around 10 metresin length.â€™[^1]

Imagine having to roll it back up. I imagine it'd be as tedious as when you drop a roll of toilet paper and have to try and get it back to normal

> Based on the hinged design of the wax tablet, the codex uses a central spine to bind multiple sheets of writing weatogether.[^1]

This is so cool. Innovation upon innovation.

> Blank space is crucial to the activity of reading, and especially silent reading, Decait enhances the legibility and comprehensibility of the page.**[^1]

Agree. I have a very hard time with huge blocks of text - much like this book!
