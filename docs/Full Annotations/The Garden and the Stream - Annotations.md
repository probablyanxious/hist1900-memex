> and everyone would have known I was a good liberal and retweeted it to prove that they were good liberals[^1]

Right off the bat I'm seeing a bit of commentary here about performative activism. Reminds me of a tweet I saw that said something along the lines of "(insert bad thing) can't be that bad, I haven't seen any instagram infographic stories on it yet"

> So far this is not terribly different than tweeting. But now I look for things to link it to.[^1]

> and on to something more timeless, integrative, iterative, something less personal and less self-assertive, something more solitary yet more connected.[^1]

> People say, well yes, but Wikipedia! Look at Wikipedia![^1]
