### Summary & Key Takeaways

In this article, Hodges looks at the work of Alan Turing and surveys his incomplete works to address the question of "what could have been?" Although there will never be a complete and true answer to this question, Hodges works to provide insight on the projects that were in the works and add to Turing's well deserved legacy.
