### Summary & Key Take Aways

In this chapter of Bonnie Mak's *How the Page Matters*, she seeks to explore and explain the dynamic relationship between the page and its content. Mak begins with the broader concepts of material and construction before delving into the nitty-gritty of more specific issues revolving around the topic. Beginning with the earliest forms of paper (scrolls using papyrus), Mak explains how we can see early signs of understanding the significance of margins and page organization are at play. Throughout the rest of the chapter, Mak explores how the design of a page (or *paginae*) encourages different interactions and how the materials and forms change. 

We must be mindful that this is focused particularly on the Western development of the codex, as it is briefly mentioned how in China paper had been used as a writing material for nearly a millennium before it caught on in the west.
