### Summary & Key Take Aways

*The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral* is a blog post authored by Mike Caufield in which he describes a more timeless vision of the web. He uses the metaphors of the garden and the stream to change help change our approach to the web, the garden being the web as a topology and the stream as the many paths with our own experience at the centre.  He uses Bush's idea of the memex and expands on it in the way he has grown his own personal wiki. The idea is cultivating the garden rather than continuing to be a part of the stream.
