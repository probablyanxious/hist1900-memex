### Summary & Key Take Aways

In *Short History of the Printing Press*, Robert Hoe (of R. Hoe & Company, a New York printing press manufacturer) reviews the history of the printing press from its earliest forms to date (at the time, 1902). He briefly touches on the art of wooden block prints that was already being used in China before explaining the methodology behind the first printing press produced by Gutenberg in the mid 1400s. He uses this book to proceed through the next 600 years in the development of printing presses and how they've improved.
