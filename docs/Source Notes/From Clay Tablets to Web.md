> - **Abstract:** The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

Kumar's article *From Clay Tablets to Web: Journey of Library Catalogue* takes on the task of reviewing the history of library catalogues. From early Romans using clay tablets to index bibliographic information to modern OPACs (online public access catalogues), Kumar delves into the constant evolution of how we manage our information. It's useful to consider how far we've come and to see the history of how we manage information as it allows us to learn from mistakes and take on better methods.
