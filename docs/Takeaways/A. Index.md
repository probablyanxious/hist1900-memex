#### In this section I will be going over in-class exercises and writing what I, believe it or not, takeaway from them. 

From the experience in the Carleton Univeristy Book Arts Lab to the "unconference style" class we had on February 6th and everything in between, I will try and share my thoughts on these exercises and shared moments within the class.

What distinguishes my takeaways from the thoughts folder is that here I am focusing on *shared* experiences, as previously mentioned. My thoughts are my thoughts, but my takeaways are influenced by the social aspect of whatever the subject is. Takeaways are from a collective experience.
