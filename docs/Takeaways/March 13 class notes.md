**comptetencies**

- Had to have all the things in line first before we get to the internet - all the competencies. Everything had to come together

- without insight, nothing works 

- we had to have imaginative leaps - the conceptualizations
	- metaphors and ideas

- **timesharing**
	- batch processing
	- these machines are way faster 	than human attention span
	- enhance the usage of the 	machines
	- making an argument on why no 	other computer might be 	necessary, foreclosing other 	options

- **The humble modem**
	- there needs to be a way of 	connecting the machine.
	- Modems adapted for SAGE system in 1953.

- **But which computer to use?**
	- Another conceptual leap - 	connecting two computers (Moving 	data around)
	- **packet switching**
		- developed in US and UK at the same time.
		- Supervening social 	necessity - nuclear war

- idea of failure of communications leading to nuclear war

- **Us political context**
	- paul baran engineer at 	RAND, focuses on secure 	communications.
	- go / no go over radio 	via am radio. military 	needs more than this.
	- baran looks at the 	current module, 	investigates mathematics 	of networks
	- fully distributed 	communication networks

- **store and forward**
	- message switching (think 	post office - integral 	message labeled with 	origin and desitnation 
	- telegraph does this, 	manually then computered
	- baran's system is not 	hierarchical - least 	congestion is the route 	taken

- **not new**
	- pulling ideas and 	concepts from one field 	and recasting it for 	another.
	- increminental jumps
	- problem was storing the 	message and woking out the 	routing.
	- broadcast analogy aint 	ideal.
	- baran proposes indivudal 	message routing.
	- faster the switches work, the fewer complete messages they have to hold onto

	- at&t already had this. miliatiry voice network built on top of the existing civilian network.
	- hardneded exchanges 
	- centrally controlled like a traffic control system.
	- autonomy in switches and computerizing the routing of things is the big idea.

- distributed adaptive messaging blockswitching!
	- packet switching. 
	- everything is digital, the message can be anything but is represented as bits 
	- air force promotes baran
	- baran and airforce withdraws from defense communications agency (they were phone people) 

- **uk political context**
	- first and second dead white men
	- concentrating on centralization 
	- not wanting the "wrong sort" to be involved 
	- task forces and projects set up
	- developing interactive / time sharing computer rather than batch processing
	- cost of long distance telecommunication 
	- davis develops packet switching to maximize a scarce resource, for baran it was about secure comms
	- no one still knows the best way to interact with computers
	- davis unveils packet switching but the british military already knew that the US had developed it. 
	- davis develops baran's work in a civilian context and he wants to bring down the cost 	- fairness and access
	- PoS transactions, database queiries, online gambling, remote data processing
	- Post office says NO
	- government interference meant that all work had to have economic spinoffs.
	- forcing computer companies to merge, killing off certain technologies and machines and components
	- driving women off to make way for upper class men.
	- britain is losing empire, they want control over the ruling class

- **meanwhile back in the us**
	- ARPA is birthed because uh oh! sputnik! (1957)
	 - space stuff needs to start. interagency politics.
	- gets its hands on some computers
	- licklider is responsible for directing computer projects at ARPA - shifts emphasis from pure calculations to things that we would recognize better today
	- solving the big problem - all these devices need to be able to communicate
	- in the case of armageddon, let's research anyway.
	- how humans interact with machines leading to interest in information theory
	- sage consoles had intergrated ashtrays
	- blue-sky paper on what if the machines talk to each other (look up for Memex "man computer symbiosis") 
	- IPTO is dolling out money to research centers
	- arpa makes a study on cooperative network timesharing
	-  a way of connecting IPNO centers together to conserve resources, arpanet project is made.
	- early computer science centers included UCLA, SRI, illinois supercomputing, MIT.
	- everyone wants a new machine, but if we can effectively wire all these places togehter then one can sit a terminal and access what they need from exisiting equipment.

- networking mini computers. IMPs using packet switching. 
	- the social dimension

- IPTO discovers Baran's 1960 paper, is now involved. 

- first request for quotes for the ARPANET comes in august 1968

- first four imps, $360,000 each.
- programming to make them work $640,000
- IPTO buys from honeywell instead.  

- imp is the ancestor to the router. how do we make this work? how do you actually make packet switching work?

- what gets designed is a fusion between baran and davis' designs.
	- fewer hardened cold war survivability, more of the high speed transmission adaptive routing. 
	- us is investing in pure research, uk sought immediate economic benefits
	- arpanet becomes more sophisticated than NPL despite being second out the gate

- englebart, influenced by as we may think, demos the online system. "the mother of all demos"
	- hugely influenced subsequent developments 

- **so much is going on!** 
	- by focusing on IMPs and how to automatically read the network for congestion, BBN IPTO & ARPA sidestep the local mainframe people
	- local mainframe people are not really on board

	- by 1968/9 things are happening fast.
	- extremely decentralized project 
	- SRI comes up with the LOGIN command 
	- many thoughts being produced by different groups

- October 29 1969 = The Birth of the Internet
	- system crashed at the G of LOGIN 

	- largely balding white guy story, but there's more to it. what else s going on here?

- "Oh we got it working, how nice." video on last slide, never seen work as momentous, the idea of what else can we do with this
