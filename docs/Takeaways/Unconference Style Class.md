In our unconference style class we were expected to come prepared with a list of observations in point form based on [questions posed by Dr. Graham](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/1.Course_Info/2.Schedule/#part-two). 

A couple of my questions/obersvations included:
- We started with archaeology, how does this weave into everything we've learned?
- Who had their stories and information priortizied when written language came into play?

We had an initial conversation with whoever was sitting near us (Hi Matthew!!) and from there Dr. Graham asked us to share what we talked about. He took note of them and then looked for ways to group the ideas that were discussed into categories. The class was divided into 3 sections, each given one of the grouped topics to further expand on. We were encouraged to find the conversation that best suited our interests. I stayed put because I was enjoying the conversation I was having with some lovely folks about the space/time economy. 

We talked for quite some time, but I decided I wanted to see what the other people around were talking about - still within our class section - just to see how the conversations differed. I found that while we were talking about space/time economy and the growing access to information, the people just a couple rows down took this conversation down the road of privacy. When I weasled my way into their conversation they were talking about privacy policies and social media.

I think it is really cool how different people will go different routes when given the same prompt.
