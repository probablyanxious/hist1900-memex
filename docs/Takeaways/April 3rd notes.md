ending term with a look at google
	- fears over computer access and fraud + the real world consequences 
	- enshittification of everything

Slide - earliest screenshot of google (1998) 
		- copyrighted by standford U 
- organizing information online

- 1990s vs 2020s web experience

- GOOGLE 
	- in search of ways to exist on the web
	- larry page begins google as a dissertation on the mathematics of the web
		- inspired by the way academic literature has backlinks (citations) 
		- "if i can operationalize that, the backlinks that point to what's important"
		- sets up webcrawler 
		- the idea of surfacing important information from a *structural* perspective rather than keyword approach
	- originally AGAINST advertising 
	- dot com boom journalism* 
	- auctions for keywords + advertising
	- early friendship between yahoo + google (stock in exchange for dropping a lawsuit)
	- Famously has to bring in parental supervision for 2001 CEO, Page. 
	- in 4 years (1999 -> 2003) the amount to buy google goes from 1 million --> 3 billion
	- dot com boom has crested by 2004
	- google has its ipo by 2004, valued at 52 billion by 2005.
	- yahoo, the early darling of the internet, fixes to build their own search engine (2004/2005)
	- web 2.0, instead of building a site you are logging in to someone else's
	- 2008 click fraud is a big problem
	- google is using cookies to track individuals by 2008 (trying to mitigate the ad fraud)
	- by 2010s google buys up other services or launches similar services to kill off competititors and keeps bad news under wraps. 

- the web as history vs history of the web
	- communication studies / theories of mass communications
	- John Thompson: “mass communication” -> “the institutionalized production and generalized diffusion of symbolic goods via the transmission and storage of information/communication." (1990)
	- search engines can fit into this definition, but they dont produce narratives or stories. 
	- 2006, "google is simply an aggregator of information" (eric schmidt)
	- they created the lens in which we view the web "i got it off of google"
	- search engines do not access the whole web - things that are not accessible to the web crawler. favouring certain types of content.
	- kremlinology
	- tech is intertwined with the social, political, and economic context in which is arises. (E van couvering, 2008)

- network science (hot in the early 2000s!)
	- how to get value out of the web 

- the problem for someone putting stuff online - attention scarcity
	- sitting in the spot of intermediation between our eye balls and where we wanna go
	- Stop shitting in the well
	- trusting results is a problem 

- early google webcrawlers
	- travel the links on a webpage
	- popular hub websites vs millions of low ranking websites 
	- this process was framed as democracy in its early days
	- google = democracy (links are a type of vote) 
	- well linked pages are more prominent
	- mainstream voices are reproduced and reinforced
	- how we know google now vs. then
	- original goal of organizing the worlds data has mixed motivations
		- stay on their site, but click on the advertising 
	- paid placements (links within search results) as a move away from banner ads
	- advertisements blended in with actual content
	- birth of search engine optimization

- Safiya noble -> hypervisibility as a means of rendering black women and girls invisible. TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NEUTRAL
	- structurally and algorithmically we are pushed towards the status quo.
	- studies google from a perspective based in black intersectional feminism
		- the way that different identities intersect, particularly online
	- searching white girls vs. black girls showing racially charged pornography for the latter. 
	- google responded instantly so that they could not replicate these searches.
	- our own identity as we intersect with google (and culturally with the search engine) shows how all these horrible currents are pushed to the surface

- recently firing of ethics researchers 
	- 2007 a company called metaweb launched a project called freebase - an open databasa that expressed data not in relational data, but as a graph.
	- power of network analysis to traverse the graph to surface answers (triples) 
	- google buys this in 2010, contextual clues aiding in search engine results.
	- announces knowledge graph in 2012 -> web on top of a web.
		- drawing on wikipedias materials without attribution (reducing use of wikipedia)
	- annotated vision of the world --> core data for large language models. 
	- take in everything they can without attribution or recompense.
	- ethical researchers are fired for pointing this out (breaking copyright, don't be evil, etc.)
	- too much money to be ethical

- aaron swartz (rip) and his influence, work, and impact
	- "Aaron's act was undoubtedly political activism, and taking such an act in the physical world would, at most, have a meant he faced light penalties akin to trespassing as part of a political protest. Because he used a computer, he instead faced long-term incarceration." - EFF
	- this brings us into the last decade-ish

- Last basic concept, the enshittification	
	- term coined by cory doctorow
	- we are seeing how platforms die.
	- Make a platform attractive, hold users hostage, abuse business customers to claw back the value for themselves.

- Amazon for example!
	- Sells goods and ships below cost, website is clean.
	- get big fast
	- locks you in with ebooks and audiobooks
	- making it hard for original users to leave (cost switching)
	- amazon prime is "free shipping" so why leave?
	- amazon marketplace = trapping businesses by subsidizing their costs
	- can't buy them anywhere but amazon, though
	- amazon traps businesses and consumers
		- preferred placement = extra fees
	- surpluses directed to users, then once locked in they go to suppliers, once locked in they go to shareholders. 

- Facebook's enshittification  ("'They trust me. Dumb fucks' - Zuckerberg")
	- originally created to creep on girls
	- early log in data was used to try and breach harvard crimson student reporters
	- facemash inspires facebook but without the hot or not feature
	- you can't take your social graph out of facebook
	- shoving posts from companies/accounts you don't follow onto your feed
	- readers don't go to the publications, completely dependent on facebook
	- facebook & google have an illegal agreement where FB gets an illegal advantage in advertising auctions in exchange for FB canning its own service.

- end-to-end principle (the idea that networks should be designed so that willing speakers' messages would be delivered to willing listeners' (doctorow)

- Give things away, make it hard to leave, give you away.
	- "Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers" (Page and Brinn 1998)

difference between content creators and writers/artists 
	- perhaps the difference between the relationship with the tool
	- sharing ideas and monetization 
	- platform receiving monetization (pushing content) / making money FOR a platform

- Drawing class to a close around the 2012 mark
	- break throughs in neural networks and the emergence of convolutional neural networks for image classification leading to improvements in performance.
	- ai is scary. 

**We made it to the end!**

- Wednesday will be building elements for final memex
- themes and intersections
- head start on final journey
- easter monday = contractually obligated to be in class (we only come if help needed!)
